# camera_server

This repo is used to control the ZED camera to start and stop recording. A server is constantly hearing from the command sent
from a joystick.
Once a button (button  6) on the joystick(Logitech Extreme) 
is pressed, a command will send to the camera server to start to recording. If button 3 or button 1 is pressed,
a command will send to the camera server to stop recording.
